# Landing-Page

This was a practice project assigned in the FlexBox section of The Odin Project. In this project I had to create a landing page based on an example image and specs given using html, css, and flexbos in css. One of the main things that I learned through the creation of the landing page was how to use flexbox properly. At first during the lessons, flexbox seemed very difficult and complicated, especially when it came to the importance of nesting. But working through each section of the website individually allowed me to see in real time how to apply flexbox to create the layuot that I wanted for the landing page. While the final product I ended up with doesn't have much individualized styling and images, the process of creating the landing page with flexbox was the more important thing. I can feel myself starting to feel confident in using flexbox to create different layouts; I'm w=excited to see what else I can create.
